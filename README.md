# BackToLife - name subject to change
This is a puzzle game. The player is placed on a grid, and is supposed to reach the end tile.
The are a couple of movable blocks: regular, slippery (goes as far as it can) and slime
(adjacent block stick to it). The game board is a rectangle of set height and width.
The is custom UI make for easier level creation in Unity editor, level creator present
in the game and, in development, the ability to share levels in the community through
LootLocker.

## Project status
As of now, work on the project is paused. It will likely resume in the summer, when
I will have more free time to dive back in. The development slowed down and eventually
stopped before completely integrating LookLocker. As of now everything works fine,
only thing to do is LootLocker integration and polish later on.
